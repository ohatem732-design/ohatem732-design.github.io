                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student at Nottingham Trent University, passionate about software development and solving real-world problems through technology. My academic journey has equipped me with strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience in database management, object-oriented programming, and web development.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoy building practical applications that address genuine needs, from bus ticketing systems to environmental sustainability research. My projects demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and test complete software solutions while following professional development practices including version control, documentation, and systematic testing.</p>
                
                <p>My goal is to contribute to innovative software development projects in a professional environment where I can apply my technical skills, continue learning cutting-edge technologies, and make a meaningful impact through code. I value continuous learning, attention to detail, and creating solutions that are both functional and user-friendly.</p>
                
                <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
                <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy staying active through football and walking, which help me maintain balance and clear thinking. These activities reflect my belief in the importance of both physical and mental well-being.</p>
